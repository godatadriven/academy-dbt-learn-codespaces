Here's an exercise for students to add a surrogate key to the `shipment_types` model by creating a union of monthly data and generating the surrogate key using the `dbt_utils` package.

## Exercise: Creating a Surrogate Key for `shipment_types` Model

### Background

In the previous exercise, you have created a new `dim_shipment_types` model by combining multiple 
monthly tables that contain information about shipment types and their associated price per kilogram. 

Now you will create a new surrogate key for the combination of `shipment_type` and `month` using the `dbt_utils` package 
to ensure each unique combination of these two columns has a distinct key.

## Add the dbt utils package to your project

- Create a `packages.yml` file in the `shipments/` folder.
- Add the required configuration to the file to install the package, you can find that here: [dbt_utils package hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/)

### Add a Surrogate Key Using `dbt_utils.surrogate_key`

In the dim_shipment_types model, use the `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` function to create a unique surrogate key for 
each combination of `shipment_type` and `month`.

You should add the following code in your model after the union alls:

{{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key(['shipment_type', 'month']) }} AS surrogate_key


### Run dbt to apply changes and verify results

Once youâ€™ve created the model, run dbt to apply the changes and generate the new surrogate key.

1. Run the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```
2. **Check the `shipment_types` Table**: Verify that the `surrogate_key` column is correctly populated for each unique combination of `shipment_type` and `month`.
3. **Ensure Correct Surrogate Key Generation**: Add a generic test to your `dim_shipment_types` model to test that it is unique and there are no nulls.

### Bonus Step: Optimize the Model

Consider adding a `date` column or a `year` column to your model, which could help with partitioning or filtering when using the `shipment_types` table in later analysis.

### Conclusion

By completing this exercise, you have learned how to:
- Add packages to your project
- Generate a surrogate key using the `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` function to ensure each combination of `shipment_type` and `month` is uniquely identified.
